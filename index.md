  <h2>About</h2>
  
  <p>I'm a Senior Solutions Engineer at Rhino Health specializing in federated computing platforms for healthcare data. With a PhD in Biomedical Informatics from Columbia University, I bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and production healthcare systems.</p>

  <p>My work enables healthcare organizations to collaborate on machine learning projects while maintaining data privacy and security—critical for advancing precision medicine and clinical research at scale.</p>

  <p>I've published 11 peer-reviewed papers on clinical NLP, HIV epidemiology, and healthcare data analytics. Currently authoring a comprehensive book on healthcare data standards, covering practical implementation of OMOP, FHIR, and genomics data harmonization.</p>
