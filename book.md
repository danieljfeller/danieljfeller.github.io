<h2>Healthcare Data Standards Book</h2>

<div class="book-section">
  <h3>A Practical Guide to Healthcare Data Standards</h3>
  
  <p>Currently authoring a comprehensive book on healthcare data standards, covering the practical implementation challenges and real-world experiences with OMOP, FHIR, and genomics data harmonization.</p>

  <p>Drawing from years of hands-on experience building production systems with OMOP databases containing 10M+ patient records and leading federated learning implementations across multiple healthcare institutions, this book bridges the gap between specification documents and actual implementation.</p>

  <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
  <ul class="book-topics">
    <li>OMOP Common Data Model: Implementation patterns and pitfalls</li>
    <li>FHIR: Practical integration strategies for real-world systems</li>
    <li>Genomics Data Harmonization: Standards and workflows</li>
    <li>Data Quality Frameworks: Building robust validation pipelines</li>
    <li>Multi-site Collaborations: Technical approaches to federated data</li>
    <li>Privacy-Preserving Analytics: Implementing secure computation</li>
    <li>ETL Best Practices: Lessons from production deployments</li>
    <li>Clinical Trial Data Standards: CDISC and beyond</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Audience</h3>
  <p>This book is designed for data scientists, software engineers, and informaticists working in healthcare who need to implement standards-based systems. It assumes technical proficiency with Python and SQL, and focuses on the practical "how" rather than just the theoretical "what."</p>
